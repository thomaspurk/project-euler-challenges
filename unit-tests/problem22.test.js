 *
 * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over
 * five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
 * alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list
 * to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
 * which is worth 3+15+12+9+14=53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938Ã—53=49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
