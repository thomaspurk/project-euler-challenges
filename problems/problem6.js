 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * ( 1 + 2 + ... + 10 )^2 = 55^2 = 3025.
 *
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
 * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers
 * and the square of the sum.
