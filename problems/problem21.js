 *
 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which
 * divide evenly into n). If d(a)=b and d(b)=a, where aâ‰ b, then a and b are an
 * amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
 *
 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55 and 110;
 * therefore d(220)=284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,2,4,71 and 142;
 * so d(284)=220. Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
